# Code Samples

A collection of code samples for various ideas, concepts, tools, etc. Some samples are authored by myself, others are either cloned/modified
from others, or written by myself following an article/book/guide.

All samples are organized by author using solution folders and written in C#. If a sample was originally written by someone else (and I cloned/modified it) or if I wrote the actual code by following a guide, it will be displayed in the solution folder with the original author's first and last name using pascal case (e.g., code samples by Tim Corey will be displayed under a solution folder named `TimCorey`). If I wrote the code myself, it will be displayed under a solution folder named `JustinianErdmier`.

I understand that solution folders only apply when viewing the code in an editor which supports solutions, so to help make the samples more accessible, here is a complete list of all samples. Additionally, I will provide a link to the original code (if applicable) and a link to the original article/book/guide (if applicable). Just as it would be displayed in an editor, all items are sorted alphabetically.
